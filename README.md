    🚀 Artificial Neural Networks for Real-World Predictions (ANN) 🤖
This repository contains several artificial neural network (ANN) projects applied to real-world datasets, including healthcare, insurance, and image classification.

    📌 Projects Overview
    
    ❤️ 1. Heart Failure Prediction
    
📝 Description: A model trained to predict the likelihood of heart failure based on patient medical records.

📊 Dataset: Heart Failure Clinical Records Dataset

📜 License: Open access for research and educational purposes.

    💰 2. Insurance Cost Prediction
    
📝 Description: An ANN model that predicts insurance charges based on personal attributes such as age, BMI, and smoking status.

📊 Dataset: Medical Cost Personal Dataset

📜 License: Dataset is publicly available, but must be used in accordance with the original license terms.

    🖼️ 3. CIFAR-10 Image Classification
    
📝 Description: A neural network model trained to classify images into 10 different classes.

📊 Dataset: CIFAR-10

📜 License: Publicly available and does not require a license. However, it is recommended to reference the original source in academic or professional work:
Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images.

    🏥 4. Breast Cancer Prediction

📝 Description: A neural network model trained to classify breast cancer as malignant or benign.

📊 Dataset: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset

📜 License: Dataset is publicly available for research but requires citation of the original source.
